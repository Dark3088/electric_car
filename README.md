GitHub App
===================================

This project is my solution for the "electric-car" Bootcamp, provided
by [Digital Innovation One](https://www.dio.me) - An Information Technology teaching platform.

App Overview
-------------

The project uses retrofit to make an asynchronous request and, if successful, render a list 
of electric cars, along with their specifics. From this point, we can:

- Save any number of cars to an internal database 
- Retrieve all cars from the database and populate a "favorite list"
- Delete a car from the favorite list
- Calculate a Car's Autonomy

You can check out [the original repository](https://github.com/digitalinnovationone/eletric-car-app) for
further reference.
